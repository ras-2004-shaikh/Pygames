# Pygames
Some of my pygame programs.
Hello everyone.
I am just a new coder. looking for some constructive critiscism.
the test1.py is just a simple pygame nothing fancy but its oddly satisfying.

you have to install pygame to run it. Try "pip install pygame" in the cm window

Try to move using the arrow keys to move jump and almost fly the ball
'b' are the horizontal breaks
there are no vertical breaks but if you press DOWN while your velocity is upwards then the ball stops suddenly
The best button is SPACE it increases your speed in whatever direction your going. Keep pressing space to continually increase speed
elasticty is set to 1 and there is no air drag
to add air drag : line 43 and 44 uncomment the rx and ry
to add elastic bounce play with the value of e. You can set it to > 1 but after sometime the ball will bounce too fast
Play with the value of ay to change gravity
you can play with the eqn in line 41 for different breaking mechanisms.
you can play with the equations on line 42 , 43 to emulate air drag (remember the air drag is in the form of accn)

throughout the program up is -ve , down is +ve , left is -ve , right is + ve

Have fun bouncing around

psst: line 18 mess around with the number in brackets cause that is sytem specific.
